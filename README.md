# Website-Backgrounds
A repository with website backgrounds. Suit yourself and choose the best one!

## How To Use
1. Choose a background of your choice from the repository; Each folder in the root is a different background.
2. Every background has a background.html file with background section marked. The section has all relevant HTML, CSS and JavaScript code used to make the background.
3. Some backgrounds might be using additional resources kept in the resources sub-folders.
4. Refer to individual markdowns available in most of the background folders for available customizations.

## Contribute To The initiative
Fork the repository, follow the structure of making a new background, create a pull request and it will be merged by us as soon as we can. Make sure that the background is pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Include CSS media queries, if required.
