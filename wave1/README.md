# Wave1
Use this background in your website and remind your clients of the sea! Well, not quite actually, but it does look amazing, pinky swear! You can preview the background before using it for your projects over [here](http://webackgrounds.devus.org/wave1/background.html).

## Custom Usage
Now quite obviously, we don't expect the background to fit your website's theme right away, the above combination of blue and orange is just a demonstration, however you can choose any of the available 16777216 colors of the spectrum. Just change the section background color of your website to change the blue part. For the orange part, an SVG file has been provided in the resources folder along with all the places where the customization has to be applied. Convert the SVG to a PNG and use as given in the code.

NOTE: The background is responsive and changes the wave height from about 50% to 30% on portrait screens for a better experience. This can be changed/removed as per the needs.
